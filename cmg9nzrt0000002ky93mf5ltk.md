Have you ever felt not smart enough? Being overwhelmed by the situation? Don’t you worry, you are not alone.

We all carry that quiet voice inside telling us we don’t belong. Sitting in a classroom, staring at the board, and thinking *maybe I’m the only one who doesn’t get it.* Walking into a new place and feeling like everyone else is already two steps ahead. These are feelings that every scientist learns to deal with.

But here’s the secret: *nobody has all the answers*. Not even the people we admire the most. What sets them apart is not certainty; **it’s curiosity**.

And yet, some of the brightest minds in history felt the same. Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize winner and one of the most brilliant physicists of the 20th century, never pretended to know everything. In his *Fun to Imagine* interviews, he spoke with joy about not having all the answers. For him, ignorance wasn’t shameful; it was the starting point of wonder.

> *“I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing. I think it’s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong.”* — Richard Feynman

## ✨Fun to imagine

—&gt; [Full interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1ww1IXRfTA)

I remember the first time I pressed play on Richard Feynman’s *Fun to Imagine*. It didn’t feel like watching a lecture. Instead, it was like joining a conversation with someone who carried the universe in his pocket. No chalkboards, no equations. Just Feynman, leaning forward in his chair, eyes sparkling as he unravelled the hidden forces shaping our world.

He jumped from magnets to fire, from rubber bands to water patterns. Every day, things suddenly stretched into infinity. A simple cup of tea became a story of atoms in motion, a flower into a tale of evolution and sunlight, a glass of wine into the history of the cosmos condensed into liquid.

What stayed with me wasn’t just the knowledge but the feeling. He made science feel alive, not as something locked away in books, but as a way to see the world differently. Watching him, I realised curiosity isn’t just about finding answers; it’s about learning to live in a universe where even the smallest detail can reveal a miracle.

He spoke with the sparkle of someone who saw the world not as a series of facts, but as an endless collection of little miracles.

## 🔮Miracle People

—&gt; [Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAX27XRHMH8)

The highlight of “*Fun to Imagine*” is when Feynman is asked a common question: Are scientists born different, with a special gift? His answer was as simple as powerful.

<div data-node-type="callout">

<div data-node-type="callout-text">“You ask me if an ordinary person, by studying hard, would get to be able to imagine these things like I imagine them? Of course! I was an ordinary person who studied hard. There’s no miracle people. It just happens they got interested in this thing and they learned all this stuff. There’s just people.”</div>

For Feynman, scientists were not miracle workers or geniuses born apart from the rest. They were ordinary men and women who chose to dedicate themselves to studying, imagining, and asking questions that others left unanswered. Or in other words, what made them different was not their nature, but their persistence.

And when he admitted that he, too, was just an ordinary person who studied hard, he was encouraging everyone to see themselves in him. It was his way of saying: “*If I could do it, so can you”.* That’s what makes this moment so powerful. Feynman’s brilliance doesn’t feel distant or unreachable. Instead, it becomes a mirror where anyone can recognise their own potential.

Maybe that’s the real legacy of Richard Feynman. Not just the diagrams that carry his name, but the way he invited us never to stop enjoying the mystery. To treat knowledge not as a destination but as an endless playground.

> *“I don’t have to know an answer. I don’t feel frightened by not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without having any purpose. It doesn’t frighten me.”* — Richard Feynman
