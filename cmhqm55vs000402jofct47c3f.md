Forgive me for breaking the blog's tone. Today I want to talk about something everyone knows, but no one dares to mention. The blue elephant in the room: AI.

To illustrate what I mean, here’s a real conversation I had last week with a university classmate:  
→ **Him:** Hey, I heard that you have a blog. Can I take a look?  
→ **Me:** Of course. \**I type the URL on his laptop\**  
→ **Him:** \**Clicks on two random articles\** Wow, looks interesting… but don’t you think you’ve used too much AI?  
→ **Me:** &gt;:(

## 🐘 The Blue Elephant in the Room

Nowadays, anyone can write a grammatically correct text using AI. Gone are the days when a bad text could be spotted by spelling errors, incoherence, or awkward phrasing. Today, everyone can write something “**acceptable,**” but behind that correctness, there is nothing more than empty, unneeded words. It is readable, but redundant and lacks content. It seems good, but is not.

That’s where the danger lies. Behind every AI-generated text hides an enormous lack of personality. By design, AI has swallowed so many voices, tones, and writing styles that what comes out is a tasteless average; an algorithmic stew of human expression.

It’s like cooking with too many spices. There’s so much mixed in that you can’t taste anything distinct anymore; you don’t even feel the intention of the cooker.

## ⚙️ The Problem

I’ve never been a fan of glorifying effort for its own sake. After all, I grew up memorising endless paragraphs and repeating math exercises that led nowhere. It’s an efficient way to classify students by performance, but it kills creativity. **It rewards mental horsepower over imagination**.

And here’s the paradox: if I had a tool that allowed me to write these articles faster without lowering quality, I’d use it without hesitation. I am the first one who relies on Grammarly or Google Translate to check my English. But that’s where the real mistake begins: believing that automation can create something with charisma.

You only need to open **LinkedIn** to witness the damage. Scroll for five minutes, and you’ll find endless AI-written posts that look more similar to prompts than real writing. Too many people are *“delighted”* or “thrilled” to announce something. The space that was once meant to highlight professional achievements is now overrun by parasites chasing likes and followers.

We’re closer than ever to the so-called *Dead Internet*: a dystopia where columnists and writers disappear, giving way to faceless algorithms. Information no longer lives in Google’s search bar but inside chatboxes of millions of lines of code: a digital oracle with no soul.

> AI needs writers, not the other way around. As long as there are passionate writers, there will always be passionate readers -”myself”

## ⚔️ My Personal Crusade

This personal crusade against AI has two opposite effects on me: one positive, one negative.

The positive one is *creativity*. I simply can’t afford to write a mediocre article. In a world where anyone with access to AI can produce something passable, I must explore new ideas, new structures, and new messages. That’s how I stay out of the algorithmic crowd.

It also pushes me to design *formats that no AI could ever dream of creating.* From my **Bingos** to *mock conversations*, I keep trying to build something that feels uniquely human.

And above all, this battle has taught me *not to fear being myself*. Be more humanly, more imperfectly, more *me*. Anyone can write, but no one can write **like me**. If I want to be special, I have to show my voice as it is unpolished, raw, and personal. Without hiding behind synonyms or trying to sound smarter than I am. Without fearing *not to be understood.*

Yet the shadow of AI is always there. It’s the first and last thing I think whenever I write. It changes how I express myself. I delete generic phrases, switch from neutral tones to personal ones, and sometimes overcorrect just to feel human again.

I’ve adopted British expressions and words (*realise* instead of *realize*), I refuse to use “—” in my essays, I use semicolons “;” and I actively avoid words overused by AI (*thrilled*, *delighted*, *empowered*…). I’ve even considered removing emojis from my titles, even though they’ve been part of my blog’s identity since day one.

These changes are neither natural nor comfortable. But they’re necessary. Because, at first impression, I want readers to *feel* that behind this blog, there’s not an algorithm but a young student made of flesh and bones. **A Spanish writer who tries to rediscover literature while sharing his passion for learning.**
